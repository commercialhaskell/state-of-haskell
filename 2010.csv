Haskell's libraries are quite good, but I think the language could really stand to have a better core API.  This is something that I think Java did very well.  The Java API provides a huge number of important libraries including GUI support.  Since it's shipped with Java and the defacto standard it provides a much more reliable platform to build on.  I realize the Haskell Platform is our attempt to solve this problem.

More specifically, lists should be head-strict and folds for which both arguments to the function are needed should be strict when the value is requested (IE sum, fold).

Prelude also conflicts with definitions in other modules.

The type system could be more expressive, perhaps taking an approach like ACL2's would be a better idea. Haskell could use a Natural class.

The Haskell standard sacrifices too much to deterministically and efficiently infer all types. GHC does attack this problem with extensions. Writing type annotations, at least at the top level, may sometimes become necessary, but I do not really think this is a problem.

Monomorphism restriction is silly, and the monomorphic types of functions in the prelude (IE taking Int instead of an Integral or [a] instead of a Foldable a) waste potential of the language.

Prelude provides folds but no unfolds.","I'm Kaidelong. If you disagree with any of this, feel free to chat with me on IRC.

A common practice for me has been to write programs in haskell that generate lazy output from some input (through STDIN) and then gets called and printed to STDOUT. Essentially a way to write intermediate parts in a pipeline I would use in a DOS batch script. Not sure what you'd call this, preprocessing.

I also use Haskell for prototyping things that will later be or Java. I would like to just write it in Haskell and be done with it, but my academic career has lately required me to do some mobile development, which in my role mandated the development of Java libraries.

You may have asked two more questions:
- what if the most exciting trend about Haskell or its community for you now?
(I don't have really an answer, but I like the work being done on infrastructure lake Hackage/Cabal, and rise of Jhc as a Haskell98/2010 haskell compiler)

The standard library needs a major overhaul: we need better performance on strings, pervasive encoding, and the numeric types need to simplified and made to match category theory more closely. Also, applicative functors need to be put in their place rather than added in as an afterthought.

Much is difficult to achieve without GHC extensions, but GHC extensions are a long way from standardization. So we're stuck in a strange place where we claim to be using a standardized language but very little works outside of GHC and the alternative implementations flounder due to lack of support, undermined by GHC's wider range of experimental features. The semantics of programs that utilize modules with mutually contradictory extensions is also confusing and feels unsafe.

There's no good comonad tutorials.","Haskell is an amazing language. I don't know what I would do without it. Despite the list of problems above it remains tremendously useful.

More emphasis needs to be put on the pros and cons of lazy evaluation and how to overcome drawbacks than to just try to push and sell lazy and pure as the new hammer for all nails.  It seems that anytime people optimize Haskell, it's about turning laziness off.  One can reasonably conclude from this that perhaps non-strict evaluation is the wrong default?

Especially debugging mixed FFI/Haskell code is really hard. (Haskell lets you debug a lot less, which is amazing, but in exchange it's a lot harder when you do have to do it.)

2?) Lack of proper IDE support -- this may just be inadequate exploration on my part, but I don't know of anything that would, say, show you the type of the expression under the cursor in a tooltip, a la KDevelop/C++ or most Java IDEs.

3) For something that's actually part of the language itself: the fact that instance matching uses only the instance head and not the constraint, besides being very counterintuitive, is also really annoying to have to work around when it comes up. It would be great if it were possible (-XSuperTurboOverlappingInstances, whatever) to have the check for overlapping instances deferred to the time of instance selection, and the compiler would only complain about overlapping instances if there were more than one (equally general) matching instance *after taking constraints into account*. (This would let you do second-order typeclass programming properly, among other things.)

4) Top-level Template Haskell splices splitting a module into stages can really suck sometimes. In general, there's two models which work: everything is in scope from the entire file/module; or only previously declared things are in scope, but you can have forward references. Top level TH splices gives you the latter except without forward references, and it really makes one want to pull their hair out at times.

5) This isn't really glaring, but a concurrent garbage collector would be nice.

There were also more complex examples and solutions. This allowed me to learn slowly and in any order. With Haskell I don't see that as much.

I understand that much of this comes from ""lots of smart people"" involved in Haskell, and perhaps not seeing a need due to the very friendly nature of the irc rooms and the mailing lists -- but the easily referencable blog posts, with pretty syntax highlighting, is desirable.","Something I would love to see in the Haskell world is a ""rate my code"" site.

They could explain the way haskell works, and problems the person is having, in a context that the questioner is familiar with.

This suggestion comes from my own experience: I am currently learning haskell by implementing various data structures I know well.

I also think Haskell platform isn't getting enough push. People still think to try Haskell means install ghc. It doesn't help that both haskell platform and ghc in various linux distro as well as MacPorts gets lagged behind badly.

the other problem is books. Thus far all the haskell books are very focused on math/logic programming.

Also a lot of the standard IO functions return IO [a] and that is incredibly hard to do anything efficiently with (at my level of knowledge).  If there were versions that took closures, it would make things so much easier.

Lastly, monad transformers are super important for anyone to write anything non trivial, but the hackage mtl docs have zero info, and not even a link to a decent transformer tutorial on the wiki.

It's easy to find low-level I/O tools (often as FFI bindings to standard C libraries) and powerful (usually pure) high-level abstractions, but combining the two is generally left as an exercise for the reader. This leads to the existence of a class of problems that are too complicated for low-level I/O to be pleasant but too simple to justify hand-rolling a higher-level library (cf. the recent reddit discussion about writing the unix ""du"" utility for an example of this). The result is usually either writing C-style structured imperative code in the IO monad, or just giving up on Haskell for such problems and using another language.

The difficulty in tackling this problem is that it's often not obvious what higher-level functionality is most frequently useful without spending a lot of time doing whatever task a library is for. To run with the ""du"" example, building something like a ""monadic system administration combinators"" library to replace shell scripting with Haskell would most likely be doomed to failure unless the author does, in fact, spend a great deal of time doing system administration.",,"Clojure, Scala, Agda or Epigram.

 - Just a personal thing, support for mixfix operators (such as the _ of Agda)
 - A better prelude (something more like the awesome prelude, supporting deeply embedding DSLs) (eg. (==) in Eq typeclass could've been BoolLike b => a -> a -> b instead of a -> a -> Bool)

Hard-to-predict operational behavior -- innocent-looking functions can blow the stack or the heap, and deep knowledge of inner workings is required when composing standard components that have to handle very large amounts of data

cabal-install is version-dependency-hell. Haskell needs import/export signature based dependencies so you can easily write adapters between package/version interfaces to get work around most ""package splits"", and to avoid having to re-specify for each new version, whether it broke the subset of the interface you used or not.

Language extensions - it looks like Haskell is not complete language ( using language extensions is like ""cheating"" or ""bad"" ), moreover it looks like there are at least 3 Haskell languages: Haskell98, TH, Haskell Prime.
I would like to write some simple game using Haskell and I think that would be fun but every library feels like it was ""experimental"", not finished, at least most of them looks like it was ""outdated"" (urls on hackage often point to 404 pages).
Haskell is the only language that I have high expectations for - it should be easy to do ""any"" (most of) graphical programs in it, when there are properly designed extensible modules with good documentation, unfortunately it lacks such modules.
I like Haskell for it's purely functional paradigm, but I can't find myself writing big projects in this language.

A big culprit is poor learning materials; even the most highly recommended books and tutorials are dense, incomplete, and hard to follow.

In the month or so that I've been learning and using the language, I've already found ""recommended"" example code linked from haskell.org that the local Haskell experts couldn't decipher, despite their years of Haskell use.  That's a really bad sign for a language.
","My take at this point is that Haskell is not yet ready for prime time.  The language shows much evidence of immaturity, with some very awkward bits (e.g. records), and a bias towards excessively dense and tricky code.

As a newcomer it was tough to see that for a while I couldn't install happstack because it depended on two things that needed two different versions of parsec (I believe it was). The answer to get it to run was to edit the cabal file and remove things, which was more than expected for someone wanting to write a hello world webapp. And then after that, haskell-src-exts didn't compile because .cabal/bin/ wasn't in my path and couldn't see happy.

Time- and space Complexity is unintuitive (I remember an article which explained 4 different fold functions: left, right, strict and lazy ones. For a commutative operation they all give the same result but different time and space complexity)

Lot's of concepts for iterating a sequence. The main one is lists. But in the recent past, there appear lots of ofther ones (functors, iteratees). So when you write a function which consumes and/or produces a sequence, it's difficult to choose one. The simple choice would be lists but I'm not sure if that's a sustainable choice.

- A debugger (more that :set -fbreak-on-exception :trace ...) would be a help. I create very very few bugs using haskell. most of them are of the nature that i did not understand the problem i was trying to solve fully. so the program does, what i told it to do and does it in the right way, but it is conceptionally wrong. unfortunately some bugs are mistakes in my implementation and they are really hard to find. well, a debugger is not an easy task....haskells benefits are so great, that i can live very good without one. but sometimes......

- the biggest weakness is, that i can not use the language at work without hiding what i am doing. i would be told to use objective-c to write buggy helper programs with much less features in twice the time. (so few features that the program will actually be worthless). on the other side this is a great personal benefit, if the world did use haskell i was just a normal everday guy. but with haskell i have super-powers...i'd rathe go for the perfect world, which uses programming languages where they are appropriate and not by stigma.",,"Erlang, Go, O'Caml, Python, Ruby, Scheme, Dylan, but is not fast enough, Erlang is slow too - as far as i know.

- now that i got a taste of how a real-world language can be insanely great thanks to theory cleverly put into application, i am scared that i am missing big by not having dependent types, codata and all, and that when we finally have them i will feel an urge to rewrite a lot of code!
- template haskell immensely useful, better than lisp macros thanks to static typing, but still not polished enough (also maybe a symptom of ad-hoc-ness?): not equally applicable in all syntactic contexts, conflicting AST representations for template haskell and haskell parser libraries, and a few other oddities.
- executables produced by ghc are surprisingly fat. whole-program optimization and object size of jhc are impressive but jhc is slow by construction.
- weaknesses of build tools for use in projects with complex filesystem structure. cabal vs. Setup.hs vs. ghc --make are still flaky. cabal and ghc can be used for in-tree builds (not installing to ~/.cabal) but this is nearly undocumented black magic. cabal supports multiple executables in one project, except not really. not all cabal ops work incrementally in make fashion (configure and depends, haddock). ghc's own build system not being really cabal-based is telling.
- other than that, the sky's the limit, and so are the programmer's skills: can a language help programmers to become better programmers or is it merely an effective recruitment filter of elite programmers?
- i am not sure haskell debuggers are adequate
- there certainly is a certain level of networking distribution that should be in standardized libraries or maybe built in the language (or even better, abstracted away by implementations)
- there are great textbooks but we need a few more, such as purely functional algorithmics (i am thinking a teaching textbook more than a ""functional gems"" book that you could compile today from ""functional pearls""), distributed computing, etc.","Haskell makes programming fun again :)

2. The prefix syntax to access record fields is awkward.  ""point.x"" or ""point->x"" is easier to use than ""x point"" for me, and ""(subfield $ field record)"" is really hard to read.  To fix the ambiguous selector case above I would add an optional constructor prefix syntax to remove ambiguity.  So instead of ""map x points"" one would be able to write ""map Point2.x points""",,"Python, Scala"

Haskell is a great research testbed but it's getting to be time to completely refactor it and design ""Haskell II"" using the best ideas from Haskell, DDC, Sweeney's POPL presentation,and whatever else.  ","I do a lot of processing of large text files where speed matters.  Even with bytestrings I usually can't get a Haskell program to run as fast as a straightforward Python script.  While the Python interpreter is quite slow, it's usually easy to write the scripts to put all the heavy lifting into built-in C libraries like dictionaries, string slicing, etc. so the scripts run fast.

The Haskell user community is great and extremely smart.  Their intelligence sometimes seems to have a negative effect on the language, since it lets them handle and embrace difficulties that should be considered crazy.  Like having to write simple programs as multi-level monad transformer stacks.","C++, Erlang, O'Caml, Python, Scala, SML, (heh) DDC?"

The haskell' committee has finally started rolling out progress, but we should see more of that. Often times one is forced to choose between vanilla Haskell vs current GHC, but there's no real guidance for how that will affect portability (i.e., whether portability may be possible in the future) or which language features and practices are now considered obsolete. Another example is the issues surrounding mtl vs more modern libraries; as well as the parsec and quickcheck versioning debacles. As such, programming practices seem more fractured now than they did in the GHC-6.6/Hugs and GHC-6.8 days. We need more ""checkpointing"" on the current state of Haskell; like Hugs used to provide vs GHC. Hopefully, UHC, JHC, and haskell' can help to reverse that trend.

Another problem regarding language design are the issues surrounding type classes, i.e. orphaned instances, the basic hierarchy, etc. These are open research areas, but it seems like if/once a solution is found, it will be considered too radical for integration to Haskell itself rather than a successor language.

8/3/2010 14:28:32,5+ years,"I'm just tinkering., I use it for my studies.",I don't use Haskell at work.,programming language theory,"Emacs / haskell-mode, Command line REPL",Scheme,"Lack of true reflection:  Because of the type system, Haskell does not have the ability to modify itself during execution without restriction.  Partially because of this restriction, Haskell is not very well suited to developing such an application as a reflective virtual world in which the interpreter/compiler running the world can be changed without restriction from within the virtual world itself.  I am interested in creating this type of virtual world at some point in the future, but because Haskell lacks true reflection, I do not believe that Haskell would be the best language for this type of application.

Unfortunately, the language which I do consider most well-suited, Squeak Smalltalk, does not seem to have a community which can communicate at the same intellectual level as the Haskell community.  In particular, there seems to be a dearth of programming language theory topics in the Squeak community; most Squeakers just seem interested in either writing or using applications, instead of discussing programming language theory.

As a result, almost every time I visit the Squeak-dev Mailing List, I get turned off (""bored out of my skull,"" to quote a phrase used once by one professor in college) by the relative lack of theoretical discussion there, and almost immediately head immediately back to the Haskell-Cafe Mailing List, which has many interesting theoretical topics.  Although some of the topics on Haskell-Cafe are over my head, other topics are relatively easy to understand (although I am a translator, and not a programmer, I did major in computer science at Yale University, and had audited courses under Paul Hudak while in college), and the generally intellectual level of most participants is probably the highest that I have seen anywhere.

While some members of the Haskell-Cafe mailing list have occasionally become upset when I have asked questions that they have seen as sometimes irrelevant (related to mathematics instead of Haskell, for example) or too trivial (one respondent in private e-mail asked me to read a textbook on type theory instead of answering a question on a doctoral thesis that he had written), overall, the discussion, while occasionally characterized by idiosyncratic humor, is extremely witty and highly intellectual.  I like the feeling of being surrounded by a group of mad scientists.

I really wish that there were a programming language community with the intellectual level of Haskell and the programming language features of Smalltalk, but as far as I know, no such community seems to exist.","I wish that Haskell would provide true reflection and a set of libraries providing an engine and tools for building a reflective virtual world similar to the kind that may eventually be able to be developed using Open Cobalt, an ""open-source virtual world browser and toolkit"" (to quote the Open Cobalt Web site (see http://www.opencobalt.org/)).

The discussions on Haskell-Cafe can be fascinating; however, the lack of sufficient libraries and tools for building a reflective virtual world without explicit use of linear algebra makes Haskell ill-suited for building the kind of application that I am interested in eventually constructing (possibly through collaborators).  Nevertheless, the lack of interesting discussions on programming language theory (or on any kind of theory at all) on Squeak-dev make that mailing list difficult (and its associated community) difficult to participate in.

I wish that I could find a discussion group devoted to programming language theory discussion focusing on building a reflective functional virtual world that does not require knowledge of linear algebra (my professor for my discrete mathematics course in college was a visiting professor who only devoted two weeks to discussing linear algebra, and partially as a result, I have not yet mastered that subject (although I am currently learning it)).","Scheme, Smalltalk"

(hint, it would be nice if the hackage website supported doing this)

 It would be really nice to have some libraries that implemented erlang style programming. Not just message passing, but the ability to have supervisors and have threads that could detect and restart crashing threads.

Development would be faster and easier if ghci supported importing only specific functions as well as ""import as"".

There's a lot of practical stuff that's missing from libraries. As an example, the zlib and bzip modules have no iteratee support and don't have support for reading line-by-line (even though the underlying c library has such). There might be some buffering library that will layer in line-by-line, but it's not clear what that is. A google search shows that someone had a patch for an iteratee based zlib, but it got rejected because of purity and not wanting dependencies. Stuff like this makes it harder for those of us needing to crank out practical code to get real world stuff done. (Ideally these libraries could/should be implemented in pure haskell rather then wrapping c libraries.)
